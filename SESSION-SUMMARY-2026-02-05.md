## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

All components follow **ReScript-TEA** (The Elm Architecture):

### Type-Safe State Management
```rescript
type state = {
  // Component-specific state
}

type msg =
  | Action1(params)
  | Action2(params)
  // ...

let update = (msg: msg, state: state): state => {
  switch msg {
  | Action1(p) => // Handle action
  | Action2(p) => // Handle action
  }
}
```

### React Integration
```rescript
@react.component
let make = (~initialState: option<state>=?, ~onStateChange: option<state => unit>=?) => {
  let (state, setState) = React.useState(() => init)

  let dispatch = (msg: msg) => {
    let newState = update(msg, state)
    setState(_ => newState)
    // Optional callback for parent component
    switch onStateChange {
    | Some(callback) => callback(newState)
    | None => ()
    }
  }

  // View rendering
  <div>...</div>
}
```

### Animation with React Hooks
```rescript
React.useEffect1(() => {
  if state.isRunning {
    let animationId = ref(0)
    let lastTime = ref(Date.now())

    let rec animate = () => {
      let deltaTime = Date.now() -. lastTime.contents
      dispatch(UpdatePositions(deltaTime))
      animationId := requestAnimationFrame(animate)
    }

    animationId := requestAnimationFrame(animate)
    Some(() => cancelAnimationFrame(animationId.contents))
  } else {
    None
  }
}, [state.isRunning])
```

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Type-Safe Variant Types
```rescript
type portState =
  | Closed
  | Open
  | Ephemeral(int) // Duration in seconds

type gapSeverity =
  | Critical
  | High
  | Medium
  | Low

type packetType =
  | HTTP | HTTPS | TCP | UDP | ICMP | DNS
```

### React Hooks for Timers
- `React.useEffect1` for ephemeral port countdown
- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth packet animation
- Proper cleanup with `Some(() => cleanup)`

### Pattern Matching
Exhaustive case handling ensures no runtime errors:
```rescript
switch state.speed {
| Paused => 0.0
| Slow => 0.5
| Normal => 1.0
| Fast => 2.0
| VeryFast => 4.0
}
```
