# selur-compose Development Progress

## Compose Parity Plan

See `docs/COMPOSE-PARITY-PLAN.adoc` for the full parity roadmap with acceptance tests.

**Created:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** MVP Implementation In Progress (68% Complete)

## Phase A Integration (In Progress)

- Wiring Svalinn /api/v2/run payloads in selur-compose
- Added bundle digest (sha256) for imageDigest
- Secrets: file-mount only, dev env injection via SELUR_DEV_SECRETS
- Healthcheck mapping into v2 config
- Added Vörðr MCP client for network/volume lifecycle
- Networks + volumes created before deploy; removed on down
- Restart policy propagated into v2 config (runtime support pending)

## Session 5 - Registry Operations (2026-01-25)

### ✅ Completed

**Commands Implemented (2 new):**
- ✅ `pull` command - Pull .ctp bundles from registry
  - Pull all services or specific services
  - Download from remote registry to local .ctp files
  - ct CLI integration (ct fetch wrapper)
  - Service name → bundle path mapping
  - Error handling and summary reporting
  - ~70 lines

- ✅ `push` command - Push .ctp bundles to registry
  - Push all services or specific services
  - Upload local .ctp bundles to remote registry
  - ct CLI integration (ct push wrapper)
  - Bundle existence checking before push
  - Clear error messages if bundle missing
  - Suggests running build first if needed

**CtClient Usage:**
- Uses existing pull() method for fetching from registry
- Uses existing push() method for uploading to registry
- Both methods already implemented in ct.rs

**Registry Workflow:**
```bash
# Build bundles from source
selur-compose build

# Push to registry
selur-compose push

# On another machine, pull from registry
selur-compose pull

# Deploy pulled bundles
selur-compose up
```
